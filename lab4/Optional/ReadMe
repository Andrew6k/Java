Create a class that describes the problem and one that describes a solution (a matching) to this problem.
Using Java Stream API, write queries that display the students who find acceptable a given list of schools, and the schools that have a given student as their top preference.
Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for students and schools.
Implement an algorithm for creating a matching, considering that each student has a score obtained at the evaluation exam and the schools rank students based on this score.
Test your algorithm.
