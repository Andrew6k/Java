Create a shell that allows reading commands from the keyboard, together with their arguments.
Represent the commands using classes instead of methods. Use an interface or an abstract class in order to desribe a generic command.
Implement the commands add, list, save, load, play (create the classes AddCommand, ListCommand, etc.).
Implement the command report: create (and open) an HTML report representing the content of the catalog.
Use a template engine such as FreeMarker or Velocity, in order to create the HTML report.
The application will signal the commands that are not valid using a custom exception.
The final form of the application will be an executable JAR archive. Identify the generated archive and launch the application from the console, using the JAR.
