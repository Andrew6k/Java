Let n be an integer given as a command line argument. Validate the argument!
Create a n x n matrix, representing the adjacency matrix of a random graph .
Display on the screen the generated matrix (you might want to use the geometric shapes from the Unicode chart to create a "pretty" representation of the matrix).
Verify if the generated graph is connected and display the connected components (if it is not).
Assuming that the generated graph is connected, implement an algorithm that creates a partial tree of the graph. Display the adjacency matrix of the tree.
For larger n display the running time of the application in nanoseconds (DO NOT display the matrices). Try n > 30_000. You might want to adjust the JVM Heap Space using the VM options -Xms4G -Xmx4G.
Launch the application from the command line, for example: java Lab1 100.
